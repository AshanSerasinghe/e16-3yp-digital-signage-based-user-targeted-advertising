Digital signage is one of the best platforms to play advertisements nowadays. The network of digital displays that are managed from a central position and shows dynamically changing content is known as digital advertising.

Main usage purposes of digital signage is for promoting products,attention grabbing content, public information systems etc. Digital advertising can be seen in many places like supermarkets, shopping malls, bus stations, clothing stores and restaurants. Advantages that come with this system are ability to deliver information to people,easy to reach a large number of crowds at once, display some attention grabbing content and reduced cost.

## PROBLEM
Most of the advertisements displayed in the digital screens are not relevant for the targeted audience. So,ninety percent of the advertisements displayed using the currently existing digital signages are not very effective. Also the provided digital signage solutions are expensive to afford for most of the SMEs(Small and Medium Enterprises). So overcoming these problems with an improved device for an affordable price will have a good market value.

## SOLUTION
To overcome this kind of issues our proposed solution consists of an upgraded version with additional hardware/software which can do User Targeted Advertising. Here our aim is while showing content that changes dynamically, when a particular crowd (male/female/children) is identified in front of the screens it will change the current content flow and show some relevant,interesting advertisement for the targeted audience that might catch their attention.

The buyer(shop owner) of the digital signage unit can upload their advertisements using the provided user authenticated web application or the mobile application. Also add some specific advertisements categorized by gender and age group. When a user in front is detected specific content will be visible to the targeted audience.

Our solution architecture mainly consists of three units. They are digital signage control unit , user detecting and analysing unit and the smart power supply unit.
